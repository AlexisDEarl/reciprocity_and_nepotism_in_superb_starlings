**Abstract**: 
Identifying the mechanisms that underlie cooperation is a fundamental question in biology, yet it is one that remains surprisingly unresolved in the majority of social vertebrates. The most complex form of cooperation in vertebrates—-including in humans-—occurs in cooperative breeders, where helpers forego reproduction and assist in raising the young of others, typically relatives. Not all cooperative societies, however, are kin-based—-nearly half of all avian and mammalian cooperative breeders form mixed-kin societies, much like those of humans. Kin selection in mixed-kin societies occurs when individuals gain indirect fitness from nepotism (the preferential helping of relatives), but helpers also frequently assist nonkin, highlighting a potential role for direct fitness in stabilizing cooperative societies. Using a 20-year study of superb starlings (Lamprotornis superbus), we examined how direct and indirect fitness jointly influence helping behavior. Although we detected nepotism, nonkin helping was common despite opportunities to aid kin. Surprisingly, specific pairs maintained long-term reciprocal helping relationships by swapping social roles across their lifetimes-—a subtle pattern of reciprocity requiring decades of observation to detect. The importance of direct and indirect
fitness varied with helpers’ sex and dispersal history. Given the frequency of nonkin helping and the occurrence of reciprocal helping among both kin and nonkin, helping behavior in superb starlings appears to be more influenced by direct fitness than by kin selection. By uncovering a cryptic yet crucial role of long-term reciprocal helping, we suggest that reciprocity is an underappreciated mechanism promoting the stability of cooperatively breeding societies.
